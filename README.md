## My process

I usually work with all the copywrite already within the code but this time I chose not to. This allowed me to focus on the areas within being distracted. 

First with the container, the onto the hero image, text and so forth. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Custom properties
- Reset properties
- Mobile-first workflow


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Reset css was something I started using in the last challenge but since looking through [Anosha's](https://github.com/anoshaahmed) code I saw just how important and practical having reset code is. 

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I want to continue to use custom properties and improve my class naming. I sometimes spend more time thinking about what name a class should be, also semantic HTML5 markup.


### Useful resources

- [Headings](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/49111/is-it-ok-to-use-h1-and-then-h3-instead-of-h1-and-then-h2) - This gave me more understanding of why it's important to use headings in each level.
